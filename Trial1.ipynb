      " Based on the provided JSON data and user query, I'll walk you through a comprehensive analysis to identify any potential issues with your network.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, let's focus on your query: \"Find if anything is wrong with my network, I'll provide the logs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To address your query, we will analyze the criticality level of each log entry. The 'criticality' field in the JSON data indicates the health status of the Wi-Fi connection for a given access point (AP). Based on the knowledge base provided, we can identify three levels of criticality: 'GOOD', 'WARNING', and 'CRITICAL'.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reviewing the logs:\n",
      "The first step is to examine the JSON data and look for any entries with a criticality level other than 'GOOD'. In this case, all the log entries have a 'criticality' level of 'GOOD'. This indicates that there are no major issues with your network based on the provided data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Signal strength:\n",
      "Another important factor to consider is signal strength. The 'signalStrength' field in the JSON data represents the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) value, which measures the power level being received by a device from an access point. A strong signal typically has a lower RSSI value, while a weak signal has a higher RSSI value. In this case, the signal strength is -58.0, which falls within the 'GOOD' range according to the threshold settings in the JSON data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Thresholds:\n",
      "The thresholds defined in the JSON data provide a reference for determining the health status of your network. The 'signalStrengthThresholds' and 'roamingThresholds' fields define the critical and warning levels for signal strength and roaming, respectively. In this case, both sets of thresholds are enabled, and the signal strength threshold is set to -73.0 for critical and -70.0 for warning. Since the actual signal strength (-58.0) falls below the warning level, it's essential to monitor this parameter closely to ensure optimal network performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the analysis of the provided JSON data and user query, there are no major issues with your network according to the given logs. However, it's crucial to continue monitoring the signal strength and other relevant parameters to maintain optimal network performance.\n"
